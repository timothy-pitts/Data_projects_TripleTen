## Part 2: Reviews
- I created a new sheet in my .pbix file for this section and named it Reviews.

- I added a new Column in the Reviews table called helpful_reviews using a DAX expression that multiplies the rating by ___1+helpful_count___
to weigh the reviews by how helpful they have been found.
- The formula in mathematical form was ___rating√ó(1+helpful_count)___.
- I then created a Card that displays the average value of this new helpful_reviews column.
- I added another new Column in the Reviews table named developer_answered using a DAX expression, where the value is 1 (TRUE) if the developer_reply column is not blank, and 
0 (FALSE) if that row is blank. 
- Finally, I created a Scatterplot comparing the average rating on the Y-axis against the value of the developer_answered column on the X-axis.
