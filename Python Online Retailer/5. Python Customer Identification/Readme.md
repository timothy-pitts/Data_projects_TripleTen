# 5. Python Customer Identification 🆔

- I created a new variable called `customer_id` and set it to the unique ID number 33510596. 
- Then, I inserted `customer_id` into the `purchase_info` list right between the product category and quantity items, making it easy to track who made the purchase in my data. 
- I printed the updated list for review! 🛒🆔👨‍💻
