# Shopify_Power_Bi_Assessment

- For the project, I was to review the landscape of apps on the Shopify platform, :iphone: using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites. 
- My goal was to figure out what key factors play into the success of a Shopify app. 
- All of this was to be done on the PowerBI program. :computer:

### For the assessment I had to:

- Find key statistics on different types of apps 
- Created charts of different reviews :bar_chart:

### Used the following to show the data:

- KPI Card :card_index:
- Line Chart :chart_with_upwards_trend:
