### I filled in the results synopsis and analysis descriptions in the “Executive Summary” sheet 📝.  

- For the **Results** section 📊, I briefly summarized the outcomes and conclusions from my analysis, pulling from both the “conversion_funnel” sheet 🔻 and the “retention_rates” sheet 🔄.
- For the **Analysis** section 🧠, I explained the important properties of the data and the assumptions I made during my work:  
- I described the raw data 📂, including the timespan ⏳, event types 🏷️, how it was collected 📡, and which parts I actually used.  
- I explained what data I used to calculate conversion rates in the funnel 🔁 (e.g. user counts 👥 vs number of transactions 💳).  
- I detailed the decisions I made in the retention cohort analysis 🔎, such as how I formed cohorts 🗂️, the timeframe over which I tracked them 📅, and how I calculated retention rates 📈.  
- I then reordered the sheet tabs ↔️ so that the “Table of Contents” 📖 and “Executive Summary” 📝 came first, followed by sheets with analytical results 📊, then calculation sheets 🔢, and finally the raw data sheets 📂 at the end (using the legend provided as a guide 🗺️).  
- I also filled in the “Table of Contents” table 📑 with the organized sheet order and included a short one-sentence description 🗒️ of each section.  
- Finally, I formatted the spreadsheets 🎨 for readability — adjusting numbers 🔢 and dates 📅, adding table borders ▫️, bolding column headers 🖊️, freezing rows 📌, and highlighting cells with calculations ✨.  

#### I used my best judgment ✅ to make the spreadsheets polished and clear, the kind of report I’d want to receive if I were an executive 💼.
