## 10. 🎓 Employee Education Impact on Startup Success  
🔥 A heated debate has emerged among our clients about whether the educational background of startup employees correlates with company success. Some argue that highly educated teams are more likely to succeed, while others claim education has little impact. To settle this debate with data, we need to compare the education levels of employees at successful companies versus those that closed after limited funding.

🚀 We'll start by identifying companies that closed after just one funding round, then analyze the educational backgrounds of their employees.

- 📝 First, make a list with the names of companies that closed down and had only one funding round while they existed.

- 👩‍💼 Then, find the employees who worked at these companies and join with the education table to analyze their degree types.

- ➗ Finally, calculate the average number of degrees per employee at these failed startups.
