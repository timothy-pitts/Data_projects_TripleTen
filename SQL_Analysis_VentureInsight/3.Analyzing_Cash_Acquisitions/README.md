## 3. Analyzing Cash Acquisitions
Our quarterly report includes a section on acquisition trends. 
The team needs to understand the volume of cash-based acquisitions (as opposed to stock deals) that occurred during the recent post-recession period (2011-2013). 
This data will help identify whether companies were primarily acquired with cash or other payment methods during this economic recovery period.

Find the total amount of company acquisitions in US dollars. Select only the deals made in cash from 2011 to 2013, inclusive.
