## 📊 I was tasked with building acquisition cohorts based on the month of each user’s first purchase and then tracking cohort metrics month by month.  
The bulk of the work came down to preparing the data for cohort analysis, which required some advanced spreadsheet techniques.  

- 🔍 I started by filtering the dataset to focus only on purchases.  
- 📄 The “raw_user_activity” sheet contained other event types like product page views and cart opens, but those weren’t relevant here.  
- ➕ To clean it up, I created a new sheet tab called “purchase_activity.”  
- 🛠️ From there, I applied a filter in the “raw_user_activity” sheet to select only rows where the event type was a purchase.  
- 📋 Once the correct rows were visible, I copied the entire filtered dataset and pasted it into the new “purchase_activity” sheet.  
- ✅ After confirming the copy, I double-checked that the new sheet only contained purchase events, verifying that it had 4,845 rows total (including headers).  
- 🔄 Finally, I reset the filter in the original “raw_user_activity” sheet so it remained intact for future work.
