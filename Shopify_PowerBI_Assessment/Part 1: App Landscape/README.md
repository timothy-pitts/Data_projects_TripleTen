## Part 1: App Landscape 🌍📱
First, I found key statistics on the types of apps that are in the dataset using the Apps table. 🔍  
I created a new sheet in my Power BI (.pbix) file called App Landscape for this analysis, and I took a screenshot for each question I answered. 📸  

- I built a KPI Card that shows the unique number of apps and added it to the App Landscape sheet. 🔢📊  
- Next, I made a Line Chart with the sum of the review count on the Y-axis and the lastmod date on the X-axis, making sure not to use the “date hierarchy” format for the X-axis. 📈🗓️  
- Finally, I created a Scatterplot with reviews_count on the X-axis and the average rating on the Y-axis. ⚡⭐  
- I then inserted a Text Box next to the scatterplot to include my interpretation of the results. 📝💡
