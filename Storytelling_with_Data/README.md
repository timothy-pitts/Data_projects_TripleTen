## What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore? 

📊 In this project, I will be preparing an analysis for the CEO of the Superstore to help them understand:
- 🛍️ What is causing customers to return their orders
- 📉 How to reduce the volume of returned orders
- 🎯 The goal was to take the same SuperStore.xls file used for the Saving [Superstore Tableau Project](https://github.com/timothy-pitts/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Saving_Superstore_Tableau_Project) and create a dashboard and captions to explain my findings.
