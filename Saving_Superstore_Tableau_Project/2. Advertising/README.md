## I explored whether advertising would be worth it for the superstore. 🎯

- Advertising impact varies over time and geography, so I focused on identifying the 3 best state-month combinations to advertise in based on average profit per unit sold. 📅📍
- I created visualizations showing the average profit for each month in those states to support my recommendations. 📊
- Using the return on ad spend (ROAS) concept, I calculated how much I would be willing to pay for advertising, assuming a maximum spend of 1/5 of profits to maximize ROI. 💰📈
