### The last steps of my analysis were to aggregate the purchase data into cohorts 📊 and then calculate retention rates for each cohort month by month 📈.  

- I grouped the data into cohorts 🗂️ by using the “purchase_activity” sheet 📄 and inserted another pivot table ➕ on a new sheet, which I named “cohort_analysis” 📝. 
- I configured the pivot table so that each cohort represented the month 📅 in which customers made their first purchase 🛒. 
- This resulted in six cohorts 6️⃣. 
- I also set up the pivot table to include the count of unique users 👥 for each cohort_age in the columns.
