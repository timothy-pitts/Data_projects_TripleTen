## 8. Fund Activity Classification
For our investor clients, understanding the activity level of different venture funds helps them identify potential co-investment partners. 
Funds that invest in many companies are often seen as having broader networks, while those with fewer investments might have deeper industry expertise. 
We need to categorize funds by their activity level to help our clients find appropriate partners.

Create a field with three categories:

- ___high_activity___ — for funds that invest in a hundred or more companies
- ___middle_activity___ — for funds that invest in between twenty (inclusive) to a hundred companies (exclusive)
- ___low_activity___ — for funds that invest in fewer than twenty companies
Print all fields from the fund table and the new field with categories.
