# 1. Purchase Info List
- I created a list called `purchase_info` 📝 that included all the data provided in the tables 📋, keeping the variables in the same order as they appeared in the precode 🧩.
- After constructing the list, I printed it out to verify that the information matched the requirements for the task ✅.
- This allowed me to apply my Python skills 🐍 for organizing and displaying purchase data in a clear, structured way. 🚀
