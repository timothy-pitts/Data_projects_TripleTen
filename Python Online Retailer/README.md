# Python Online Retailer

- I completed a hands-on project 🛠️ where I analyzed purchase data 📦 from a customer of an online retailer 🛒 that sells a variety of products. 
- Using Python 🐍, I worked through several tasks that required manipulating lists and tuples 📊 to extract meaningful insights from the raw data.
- This exercise demonstrated my ability to work with real-world datasets 🌎, Python skills 🧠, and effectively communicate findings 💬—a vital skill set for data-driven decision making in e-commerce and retail environments. 📈
