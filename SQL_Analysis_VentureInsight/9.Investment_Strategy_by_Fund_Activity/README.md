## 9. 🎯 Investment Strategy by Fund Activity

Building on our 📂 fund activity classification, our research team wants to understand how a fund's 🏦 investment approach changes based on its activity level.  

📌 Specifically, we want to know if funds that invest in more companies tend to participate in more 💵 funding rounds per company.  
This insight will help our clients understand different 🤝 fund strategies and how broadly or deeply funds typically engage with their 📊 portfolio companies.  

➡️ For each activity category assigned in the previous task:  
   - 🔢 Calculate the **average** number of funding rounds the fund participated in (rounded to the nearest whole number).  
   - 🏷️ Print the categories and the averages.  
   - 📑 Sort the table by the average in ascending order ⬆️.
