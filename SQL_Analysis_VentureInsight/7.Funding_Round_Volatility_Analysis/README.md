## 7. Funding Round Volatility Analysis
Our risk analysis team is examining volatility in funding rounds. 
They're specifically interested in dates where there was significant variation between the smallest and largest rounds. 
This indicates days when both very small and very large companies were receiving funding, which could signal unusual market activity. 
They also want to exclude days where some companies received no funding at all, as that skews the analysis.

Create a table showing the highest and lowest amount of money raised for each date in the funding_round table. 
Include the dates in your results. The resulting table should only have records where the lowest value is not equal to zero or to the highest value.
