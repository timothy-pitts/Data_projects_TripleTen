## The executive team wanted to understand how well the website was converting product page views into purchases. 
- My first task was to create a conversion funnel to get better insights into how users interact with the site.
- I used data from the “raw_user_activity” sheet to build the funnel in a pivot table, creating a new sheet called “conversion_funnel.” 
- I made sure to count unique users at each stage of the funnel, which I structured into three stages.

- Then, I added two new columns to the pivot table using formulas:
  - One for total conversion rates and another for conversion rates to the next step,
  - Another for referencing the Overview of Funnels lesson to guide the calculations.
