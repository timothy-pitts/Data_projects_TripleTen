## 1. Which neighborhoods and property sizes i.e. number of bedrooms are most attractive for vacation rentals?

- To answer this question, I analyzed the information using pivot tables. 
- I looked at which neighborhoods are the most attractive for vacation rentals, as well as the property sizes (number of bedrooms) that are the most popular. 
- I also examined whether different neighborhoods have different preferences for property sizes.

- To assess a listing’s attractiveness, I used the number of days each property had been rented as a measure.
- Since reviews are a good estimate of how often an Airbnb property is rented—because they only appear after a stay—I assumed they reflected rental frequency and used them as a proxy for attractiveness.

- I discovered the three most attractive neighborhoods from the pivot table were Greenpoint, Harlem, and Hell's Kitchen.
