## 1. Startup Landscape Analysis
Before diving into specific analyses, your first task is to understand the overall startup landscape in our database.
The executive team needs a snapshot of how many companies have failed (closed down) versus how many are still operating or have been acquired.
This will help establish the baseline success rate in the startup ecosystem.

Calculate the number of companies that have been closed down.
