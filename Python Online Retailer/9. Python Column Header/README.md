# 9. Python Column Header

- To make my data table clearer:
  - I took the header names from my source file (which were separated by double underscores),
  - I split them into a list called `columns`
  - I joined them back together using a vertical bar with spaces as the separator. 
- Finally, I printed my newly formatted header string. 🪄🗂️✨
