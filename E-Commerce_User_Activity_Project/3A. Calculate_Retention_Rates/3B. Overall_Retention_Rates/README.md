### I created a new blank sheet called “retention_rates” 📝, which I used to layout a table that looked similar to the “cohort_analysis” sheet 📊.  

- I added row labels in cells A3 to A7 🔠 for each cohort in chronological order 📅. 
- Then, I added column labels in cells B2 to E2 📋 to represent the cohort ages from 1️⃣ to 4️⃣ months.
- In cell B3, I wrote a formula ➗ that calculated the retention rate for each cohort at each cohort age, based on the starting cohort sizes 👥.
