## I constructed my story arc for the presentation 🎬
- I started by drafting my story using only captions for each Story Point 📝
- I created a duplicate of this draft version (captions only) to submit 📑
### In my draft Story, I included:
- A summary of my analysis of returns 📊
- My evaluation of how returns should be measured:
  - Return rate
  - Total cost of returns
  - Total number of returns — and when one is better than the other
### Below I posted the video that does the following:
- The key root causes of returns 🔍
- An overview of each component of my Dashboard 🖥️
- Explanations of what is contained in each chart and how they should be interpreted 📈
- A demonstration of how the Dashboard should be used 🧭
- Instructions on how to interpret the Dashboard and apply filters to identify root causes 🎛️
- A description of actions that can be taken after identifying these causes 🛠️
- A conclusion with proposed next steps, such as implementing the Dashboard 🚀
### After outlining, I added content to the Story Points:
- I used worksheets I had already created 📄 and built new ones when necessary to support my Story Arc ➕
- I constructed Dashboards to resemble presentation-style slides 🖼️
- I saved a completed version of my Tableau Story 💾
- Finally, I prepared and delivered a 3 to 5 minute presentation of my Tableau Story 🎤
