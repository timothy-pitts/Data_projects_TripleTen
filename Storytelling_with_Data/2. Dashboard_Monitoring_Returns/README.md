## In this section I began creating dashboards to monitor returns
- I started this section by creating a low-fidelity mock-up of my dashboard 📝.
- I made at least three variations of pen-and-paper sketches ✍️✍️✍️ and then scanned or took photos of them 📸 to submit.
- I created a template for the dashboard using empty containers to match my mock-ups 📐.
- I took a screenshot 🖼️ and included it with the rest of my project files 📂.
- Next, I added my worksheets to the dashboard template 📊.
- Finally, I polished everything by adding relevant markers, images, and titles 🎨.
